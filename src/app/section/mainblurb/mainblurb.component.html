  This website was origionally done as a Web Authoring assignment, but was developed (aesthetically) from a
  previous project
  and will be used as a dynamic template for further projects. <br>
  It also started as a simple HTML-based project.
  Interestingly,
  although the visual layout hasn't really changed much,
  the methods of doing various tasks has: <br>
  For example,
  the site went from being HTML ad CSS based to HTML and SCSS based.
  Additionally, this has evolved with my introduction to Angular, and now some JaaScript elements are being
  experimented with.
