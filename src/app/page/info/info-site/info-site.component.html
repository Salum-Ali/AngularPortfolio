  It all started as a simple HTML-based project.
  Interestingly,
  although the visual layout hasn't really changed much,
  the methods of doing various tasks has. <br>
  For example,
  the site went from being simply HTML/CSS based to HTML/<b>S</b>CSS based.
  Additionally, this has evolved with my introduction to Angular JS, and now some JavaScript elements are being
  experimented with.
